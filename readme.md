# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissor game made in python following [Dave gray's python course](https://youtu.be/H2EJuAcrZYU?si=3USXQc-AyM22Ycce).

## Version 1
- Used basic things like if-else to decide the winner, sys to exit the program, random for computer choice, enum for number and rps relation. 

## Version 2
- Included a while loop so that a user can play as long as he wishes to continue.
- The game continues if user types Y for yes and ends if user types Q for quit 

## Version 3
- Refactored the game to use recursion to play the game again

## Version 4
- Removed global variables by using closure, game now shows total games played and number of wins.
- Refactored code to use fstrings and turned it into a module.
